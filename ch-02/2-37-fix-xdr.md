### A.Does your code provide any improvement over the original?
The asize variable will be converted to size_t when calling malloc(). So the change doesn't make a differece.
### B. How would you change the code to eliminate the vulnerability?
Since malloc only allows 32-bit number, we should return NULL when the multiplication overflows.
